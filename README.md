<h2 style=color:#fe5e21;>Data Collection</h2>

The dataset was developed by extracting frames from this YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HaJArMDKgI&ab_channel=JUtah) and was annotated mostly using **Roboflow's auto-labeling** feature in both using python scripts and roboflow platform.
Some samples of the dataset are given below.
